# Smart-Diet-Optimization-and-Regression-

Imagine a world where everyone, regardless of their financial situation, can have access to a nutritious and affordable diet. Many individuals and communities struggle to maintain a healthy diet due to financial constraints. This project addresses the challenge of balancing nutritional needs with cost efficiency, making it an urgent issue for public health and individual well-being. so I Developed an optimization model to create cost-effective nutritional plans that meet specific dietary goals, such as weight loss or managing health conditions. Uses regression techniques to find the best food combinations at the lowest cost, improving both health and affordability.
